The guys at Dreamsium Corporation just installed unauthorized extension in my Zakuska Tram! And they are eating my privacy with their ADVERTISEMENT money!
Suggestions for solution? I'm thinking about running Google Chrome or Edge in Wine instead. I have really lost my trust on the CrDreamsi Corporation.
